Dear Good Sir,
I wanna keep this brief as I want to sleep soon, but I wanted to write something. I’m doing pretty well right now to be honest. I am just really enjoying life right now. Despite all of the rush and busyness today. The people that I am so fortunate to interact with in the many, many circles that I have somehow exposed myself to are so just wonderful. I feel blessed to be honest. There are just so many cool people around.
And don’t even get me started about Kyoto next quarter. I am SO excited. I’m not even gonna list exhaustively as I know I could, but JAPAN for months on top of practicing Japanese nearly 24/7 on top of getting to meet and see again lots of nihonjin that I am getting to know now or have met in the past. It’s gonna be sweet. Keep praying for the protest stuff to work out well to allow me to go to Kyoto without hinderance. This is certainly one of the things in my life that I could argue I actually NEED to do. But yeah. KYOTO!!!
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
