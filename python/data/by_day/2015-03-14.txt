Dear Good Sir,
In the spirit of yesterday’s journal, I want to again emphasize care for yourself. And caution. I noticed this morning after seeing so many messages from your nihonjin friends a feeling of ah they really care. Come on now. You don’t need this to know that they care. And not seeing that doesn’t mean they don’t care. Don’t let the shortcomings of one-dimensional messaging suggest anything else.
Again, respect their time. It even took you awhile to respond today because you were busy this time. Busyness is real. Respect that they are people and have busyness. Appreciate when they respond, but don’t let that be the only way that you believe that they care or whatever. That’s ridiculous.
I’m sorry I am very tired, so I probably don’t sound very coherent at the moment. Or at least I don’t feel like it. But you get my point hopefully.
Thanks, Sexy Marcus Circus Francium Jackson
