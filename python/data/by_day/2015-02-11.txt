Dear Good Sir,
I may have solved the staying awake problem which has been plaguing me for years upon years, i.e. the problem of not being able to stay awake in lectures, presentations, etc. I’ve tried all sorts of things in the past from to inflicting pain, raising limbs, and other absurd things. But nothing has worked reliably or brings with it other problems. But I think I have a reliable and solely positive solution. Sitting up. As in not sitting back in the seat. As in making an effort to sit up and keep your back straight. Yeah. It’s that simple. 
I just randomly instinctively found myself doing it this evening at a presentation/talk thing when I resolved at the beginning that I really needed to stay awake for this. My immediate response to this resolve was sitting up straight. As if I already knew that this was the solution or something. I feel like a lot of the time we do know what is the solution to certain problems we experience or face, but we don’t consciously realize that we know it until after we’ve automatically dished out the solution. Anyways, I’ll try it out more in the future to see if this actually works.
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
