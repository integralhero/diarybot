Dear Good Sir,
There was a rather funny moment tonight when I had dinner with Debra worth noting. She had been telling me about her incident with Yanshu where he eventually made an offensive socioeconomic comment that pissed her off (Debra mad? Whoa, I know right?). In the middle of her telling me the story, Axel randomly saw me and decided to join us at the table without really asking despite her being in the middle of this tale though he wasn’t necessarily aware of that. 
Later, after Alex had joined the table as well which indirectly allowed Debra to continue her story through Axel and Alex talking to each other, Debra was telling a separate short thing of an example of how Yanshu can be a bit unaware sometimes. She explained how she was talking personal things with Dina and Katrina when Yanshu saw them at the table and joined them without asking which was rather annoying to them especially he didn’t even know them. As she was telling this, she was also saying how you gotta call these things out and such. All I was thinking was the total double meaning going on here. How Axel had just done the same thing to us. I could not figure out if she was doing this on purpose as in intending the double meaning.
I asked her later on afterwards and she said she had not thought about the double meaning and irony before I mentioned it, finding it hilarious. Though to be fair for Axel, he did seem hesitant after he sat down, and we didn’t ask him to go or anything as we didn’t mind. I’m not sure the same could be same in Yanshu’s case.
I want to complement you on your hard work on the 221 assignment today. Though you didn’t manage to finish it before 11 as I was gunning for, you still made significant significant progress on it and really put a lot of time into it without distraction and such. So good work. Let’s keep doing that and make it through the rest of these assignments and such the next few weeks. GANBAROU!
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
