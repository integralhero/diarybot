Dear Good Sir,
I repeat, no despair! I don’t care that I had to turn in my 131 assignment incomplete. Screw Matlab for eluding David and I in a bug for so long to the point of us not having time to finish the rest of the assignment. Who cares! It’s one assignment out of many for the class not including the final. And hey, stuff like this probably happens to everyone. And we need to shift our working time to adjusting to when office hours is I guess. That’s hard when I have constant 221 over my head. But hey, you can make it. As you point out, all you have to do is survive. Do decently. There’s no need or requirement to do EXCEPTIONALLY WELL. No pressure, no sarcasm suggested, yo.
I am rather annoyed by your lack of consistency in your feelings for Crystal. One minute you’re trying to make a jump at a decision due to circumstances randomly causing for us to have dinner instead of lunch on Friday. The next, you’re not sure how you feel anymore anyway. I’m kinda glad that going to Palo Alto was tabled for now as now I don’t have to deal with you trying to jump at a decision that has left you indecisive for awhile now. Using circumstances to break indecision is generally totally cool and all, but not for important decisions like this, yo.
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
