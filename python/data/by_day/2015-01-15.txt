Dear Good Sir,
I am very tired. So I must keep this brief despite having a lot I want to say. I suppose the most relevant and time specific is that I decided this morning to just go ahead and make the call not to go to WROLC. Honestly, I think I may have been able to pull it off, but I really want to remove myself from this grind, and I certainly feel like I’d still be in the grinder even if I managed to pull off going and getting assignments done on time. Now, I’ll have an abundance of time and lots of inspiration and real reason in not wasting this time I’ve bestowed upon myself through sacrifice.
Honestly, I wanna write so much more, but I just must ask you for your own sake to go to bed, please. Self-kindness is a thing, yo.
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
