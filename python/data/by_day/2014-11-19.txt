Dear Good Sir,
Ah, I wish I had my camera during my run today. It was beautiful. So I’ll paint a picture from my mental snapshot. I was running at The Dish, the shorter leg of it. I reached and climbed the final hill along this way. Before this, the sky had already been so beautiful to me with the look of rain clouds all around and splotches of lighter areas where the sound pierces slightly more and darker areas thick with water. Upon reaching the top and starting to go down the hill on the other side, I looked out at the beautiful view to my right revealing Stanford and beyond. 
That’s when I saw it. A rainbow. Yes. In California. I honestly have never seen one here before. I could see it coming out of the clouds to the right, and after following where the arch would be behind the clouds, I found the other side of it too! What a beautiful sight on an already beautiful day and run. I really have to appreciate these gift moments from the Universe. There is just something special sometimes there for you, but you really have to take the time to notice and appreciate it otherwise you’ll just pass it by.
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
