Dear Good Sir,
The unexpected happened tonight. Or I guess not super unexpected. But I wasn’t expecting it tonight. Crystal texted me. Texted me, yes. I know that sounds ominous if it’s what you think it is. But there’s an explanation. She did deliver her answer via text. Which she regretted to do, but she did only because she wanted to get back to me sooner and she didn’t think she’d be able to talk about it in person this week, which I appreciate the sooner-ness. Her answer is that a more-than-friends relationship is not what she’s looking for right now. Which I totally respect and can understand. She pre-empted with hoping we can still be friends, so I totally have no worries in that regard.
How do I feel as a result? Surprisingly not as disappointed as I would think. Maybe I did guard myself significantly over these past few days. Or maybe it hasn’t quite hit me? I don’t know. But it’s okay I guess. It at least wasn’t a just no or anything. If anything maybe this could open something down the road? Or maybe, I don’t even want to think that far. Who knows. But I’m okay. She and I are okay. That’s all that really matters, right?
If you need anything, I’m ALWAYS here for you, bro.
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
