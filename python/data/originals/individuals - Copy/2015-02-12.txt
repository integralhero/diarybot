Dear Good Sir,
I must implore you, good sir. You need to look after yourself more so. Today was never easy. But was not made any easier by all of the other things going on today that you were trying to deal with. Basically, all the Tahoe stuff. Sure, progress is good, but I feel like I spent way too much time and energy on it today and started getting really stressed especially with not feeling that I was getting anywhere with studying.
Honestly, I don’t know how I got into this hole, especially without realizing that I’ve been in it until this quarter. The hole of WAY too much extracurricular commitment. I understand that this has been a lot of your community and identity at Stanford. But somehow, I’ve been convinced for quite awhile that doing two major clubs was somehow necessary or something or expected even. Yeah, I made a good decision in dropping Splash, but then I just added SJEC right in.
But it’s also just hard when everything’s so cool and awesome, and you wanna do everything. And I have to be thankful that I am at least fully aware of the entire doing way too much hole that I’ve dug. And I have big plans to change that for next year. I just wish I could do more this quarter knowing how burnt out and being dragged along I am right now. But I don’t see much that could be done, besides maybe trying to get out of Tahoe. But I’m not sure how that could work at this point.
I have a lot more I wanna write about, but no time at the moment, so look for more tomorrow. Monterey soon too!
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
