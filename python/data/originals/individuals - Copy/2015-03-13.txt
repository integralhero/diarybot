Dear Good Sir,
Check yo self. I’ve been a bit off all day. As in, sad or something along those lines. It’s hard to pinpoint when it started or the direct cause, but I don’t think it was simply one thing which makes it so difficult. I think part of it had to do with this morning’s weird thing with Erina which started off fine, but left me in a weird place. Essentially, I was going to help her back into the LINE group after she somehow lost her account in changing phones, but I was trying to mess with her, then suddenly it said Russ added her to the group and I was left feeling dumb.
I don’t think it was so much that latter part but more so the effect of trying to mess with her through message, but by nature not getting feedback making the act unclear how it was being taken. And you know me and my worst case scenario’ing. I think it is this that started off my weird state for most of the day. That coupled with sadness over the students being gone hitting me again. In other words, one thing leading to another and building off each other leading to spiraling downward process that’s never good. 
I was able to do some brainstorming and remembered two of my good techniques for mental resets to feel better. One being reading and the other being night biking. Falling asleep works too though that requires actually being able to fall asleep. But yeah. Remember these different tools that I have for mental resets and please utilize them, especially early on. Stuff like this happens which I understand, but no point in not doing anything about it once you identify that something is happening to begin with.
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
