Dear Good Sir,
SJEC is off to a good start. I look forward to really getting to know these students. They all seem really cool off the bat. I’m especially looking forward to Monterey and Tahoe. Until then though, I got some more pushing to do in terms of CS110. It might be tiny, but it’s still a decent little shell to implement. Wish me luck.
I apologize for the lack tonight of stuff, but I don’t much feel like writing at the moment. I’m fine I suppose, but yeah, I just don’t have much to write about at least that’s sticking out. More another time.
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
