Dear Good Sir,
Apparently, I’m about to turn 21. Whoa. I think? I guess this means I am officially an adult? Not that I wasn’t before. But now I can really let myself let go of all beliefs that I am a child. Right?
But I like being a child. And there are certain things associated with children that I feel like are ok. In fact, quite good of things. Things to hold onto because they tend to float away on their own. As in, trying to push them away only makes it worse. I suppose I am referring to the fun and imaginative nature of children. The care-freeness in terms of not getting lost in the complicatedness of life. Letting things be simpler than they have to be.
Yet, being an adult is a good thing too. While there are lots of responsibilities as a result, along with that comes lots of freedoms. Freedom to be me. As long as you actually take that freedom and run with it. Because a lot of the time, I feel like you aren’t doing this. Instead, you are just following others, drifting along by their ebb and flow instead of by your own. Sure, doing things with others is always good. I just mean be sure to create your own experience too. Influence what you do. Even when it’s going along with others’ plans. You can still influence even in that case. Remember, the wonderful duality of consciousness. Not only do you get to watch your story as it unfolds, but you also get to influence and direct and change how it goes. You are both the actor and observer. Embrace this duality.
By the way, it looks like you’re in the green for being showered. At least today. I do feel like I got showered on the day of last year…
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
