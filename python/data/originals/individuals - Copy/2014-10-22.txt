Dear Good Sir,
I had my SJEC group interview today. It went okay. There was some nervousness that I noticed as I answered the first question that I could detect from my voice and from my hands, hopefully neither of which was all that noticeable to everyone else. By focusing on removing the nervousness through some sort of acknowledging that it is unnecessary, I was able to pretty much remove which I think helped. I think this is definitely something reproducible and perhaps even so possible before the interview or whatever else in the future. It just takes the mindfulness and the focus on nervousness specifically.
Hey bro. You’ve got this. Don’t be brought down by the work. Rise up. TO THE CHALLENGE. I believe in your ability to leap hurdles. You’ve been doing it since like age 4 or younger. GANBAROU!
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
