Dear Pro Bro,
I was at a point come Friday that I thought that was I moving back on top of work and all. And I got a decent amount done this weekend, but due to unforeseen difficulties with 131, I’m not sure anymore. Now, David and I are going to be at the last minute doing this pset, then I also have a big 221 assignment looming over me, and even beyond that, the project progress report due next week. And Splash is this next weekend, so I need to prepare for that. Plus, constant Japanese stuff to do. And SOOP and SJEC. And now I have to deal with re-doing my wounds every morning. So much!
But hey, no despair. When it comes down to it, I’m going to Kyoto in the spring. My grades really don’t matter that much as long as I keep them decent enough. Thanksgiving is only a few weeks away. I am moving closer to wanting to make a move on my feelings for Crystal. My dream stuff is moving along if not getting much better again. I’m alive. That’s the big one.
I know it’s hard, bro, but keep pushing. You’ve got LOTS and LOTS of support behind you, not to mention from me. I’ve seen you make it through far worse in far worse conditions even mentally, so again, I KNOW YOU’VE GOT THIS, LET’S GO!
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
