Dear Good Sir,
After attending the life group this evening, I was left in a very weird state. It’s hard to describe the cause. Part of it is the confusion over knowing where I am spiritually. And I think it had something to do with hearing a lot of the unfortunate things going on for some of them, but also the way that they were framing it, bringing up the devil and evil often. I’m just not used to hearing things like this, so it’s hard for me to process it all normally. 
After talking to Alex though, I see that something I should probably do is talk to Glen again. Maybe review Mere Christianity some more first, but then yeah. He helped give me spiritual direction last time, so I’m sure he can do it again, especially right now when I really need it.
I’ve heard some really disturbing rumors tonight. REALLY disturbing. Regarding the protest and something that it may have led to. So disturbing that I’ve had some disturbing thoughts that I don’t want to talk about. I hope the rumors aren’t true. That’s all I can really say. I guess I’ll learn more tomorrow.
Bro, I and so many others are here for you. Just please remember that. God, hopefully, too.
Best wishes,
Marcus Francium Jackson
