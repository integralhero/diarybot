Dear Good Sir,
Check yo self! I don’t know what these feelings of meh that have overcome me the past few hours are about, but I don’t think they belong. You were so happy and content after work after you had just been reading, but something changed somewhere. What the hell happened? All that took place in between was Destiny, which was frustrating, yes, but I don’t really see that being the cause. Knowing me, it is probably that a seed of negativity was planted at some point and grew while I wasn’t looking. But what?
Looking deep, part of it almost feels like it is hopelessness regarding Chelsea. Which makes no sense. Where the heck did you get that from? Since when was that hopeless? Is it that you don’t want to wait a month or something? I can recall some thinking now regarding whether you think she would be expecting more action right now opposed to later. But where did you get hopelessness from there, yo? In fact, I don’t know at all how you could have reached that conclusion at all, especially, since there has been absolutely nothing that has changed since last night. No new info. No new action. No new anything.
In fact, if anything, you should be happy right now because one thing regarding her potentially that has changed or appeared is this EPA march on Thursday which could possibly present another opportunity to see her before the break begins (outside of chance encounters). So perk up, dude. I know you can handle a month of waiting before I allow you to really start thinking about the matter and start thinking about action, etc. Or if you can’t, then imagine 5 months in Japan, HA! You wouldn’t last a second. So let’s get better about this. I understand what you think of her and how you feel or want to feel anyway, since I am pushing off a lot of it right now temporarily. But it’s not time yet. Be patient. I have a lot of self-reflection to do before that point arrives.
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
