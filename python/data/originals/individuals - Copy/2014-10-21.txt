Dear Good Sir,
I listened to a very curious podcast today from This American Life, Act V. It followed inmates in a high security prison as they practiced and practiced Act V of Hamlet (they perform the acts one by one due to prison constraints) then performed it. It’s a program through a theatre organization that works with prisons and such. This type of program, which reminds me of the super meditation retreat program brought into prisons, in the transforming effect that it has on those inmates that take part. It’s these types of programs and listening to how transformed and different these people are that make me not be in favor of the death sentence.
But beyond that, something that one of the inmates said about this acting program really moved me. He talked about getting to come in every day and interact with the lady that was training and helping them practice, and having all of these different professors come in occasionally and such. He said that this whole thing allowed him and the others “feel human” for a few hours each week. In a place where they are normally used to being treated as not human, having inhumane things happening all of the time. The idea of needing something to help you feel human says a lot about the lifestyle that they are stuck in as a result of being incarcerated. It also says a lot about how this man has changed to be able to recognize such things and be able to appreciate this program for this reason. Once again TAL captures something so powerful.
Thanks, Marcus Francium Jackson
